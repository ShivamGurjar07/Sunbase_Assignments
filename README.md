## Overview
The Form Designer is a web application that lets users create, edit, and rearrange form elements dynamically through a simple drag-and-drop interface. Users can add input fields, dropdowns, text areas, and checkboxes, then save the form structure as a JSON file.

## Features
### Add Form Elements: Easily add text inputs, dropdowns, text areas, and checkboxes to your form.  
### Rearrange with Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and move form elements to change their order.  
### Delete Unwanted Fields: Remove any form element with a single click.  
### Save Your Form: The form structure is saved as JSON and logged in the console for later use.  
### Automatic Saving: Your form is stored in local storage, so you wonâ€™t lose your progress.
